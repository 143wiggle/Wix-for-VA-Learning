Wix — Purpose and Definition
Definition:
Wix is a free, drag-and-drop website builder that allows users to create and design professional websites without any coding knowledge. With built-in tools for customization, media uploads, forms, and integrations, Wix is one of the most beginner-friendly platforms for personal and business websites.

Purpose (as a Virtual Assistant Tool):
Wix empowers Virtual Assistants to create, update, and manage client websites — even without advanced tech skills. It allows VAs to assist with basic web tasks like editing content, building landing pages, inserting contact forms, or showcasing client portfolios.

It also helps VAs build their own online resume or service page, making them more marketable.

Key Uses for Virtual Assistants:
Creating a landing page or personal VA portfolio

Editing text, images, and contact info on a client’s Wix site

Adding or rearranging pages, buttons, and sections

Embedding media like YouTube, Loom, or Google Forms

Connecting contact forms to client emails

Publishing and sharing the final site link with clients

Using Wix automations for basic follow-up and alerts

Why VAs Must Master Wix:
It lets you offer more services (web editing, basic design, SEO help)

Makes you look professional online with your own Wix site or VA landing page

Allows you to respond to urgent client edits quickly, without hiring a web developer

Helps you support small business owners who want basic web presence

It’s a skill that adds real value to your VA resume and Upwork gigs
